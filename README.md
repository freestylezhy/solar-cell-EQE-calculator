# solar-cell-EQE-calculator

This Matlab program calculates the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a solar cell given the solar cell materials and structral parameters. It uses the transfer matrix method to calcualte the optical absorption in each layer of solar cells. The EQE is the absorption in the active layer of solar cell.
